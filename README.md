# ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Predictor


## Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for 31% of all deaths. This project addresses the critical need for early detection and management of heart failure, a common consequence of CVDs. By leveraging a machine learning model, the project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on various health-related features. This predictive tool will empower healthcare providers to implement timely interventions, reducing the risk of fatalities and improving patientsâ€™ quality of life.

## Problem Statement
Heart failure poses a significant global health risk, particularly for individuals with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. This projectâ€™s objective is to build a machine learning model capable of analyzing medical data to accurately predict heart failure risk. By prioritizing recall, the model minimizes the risk of false negatives, ensuring high-risk individuals are identified for timely intervention.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries:
1) Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
2) Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
3) Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost
4) Models: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier
5) Statistical Analysis: statsmodels
6) Balancing Techniques: SMOTE
   
## Recommendations
* Healthcare providers can integrate this model into clinical workflows to support early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
* Further improvements can be achieved by incorporating additional data sources, such as genetic or lifestyle factors.
* Implementing this tool in preventive healthcare programs can significantly enhance outcomes for at-risk populations.
